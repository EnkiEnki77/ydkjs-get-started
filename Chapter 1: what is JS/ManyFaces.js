// A paradigm is universal mindset and approach to structuring code.

//The three main paradigms are procedural, OOP, and FP.

// procedural orders code in a top down linear progression through a pre determined set of operations, known as procedures. 

//OO collects logic and data together into classes. 

// FP organizes code into pure functions, and the adaptations of those functions as values. 

//JS is a multi-paradigm language, meaning you write code line by line in any paradigm you see fit.
